write a proper polite complaint about a product or service

Good afternoon,

I am writing to file a complaint about a smartphone I bought from your company. I was sent a device which did not work, and was left without a phone for over a week. I reached Customer Service, and a very polite representative gave me the contact details to write this email and seek compensation. 

It would be to my liking to solve this problem with you, as this has been the only non-favorable experience I have had buying from your company. The product is under warranty and has not been used except for when it was tested and did not work.

Thanks,
Francesco Fevoli
