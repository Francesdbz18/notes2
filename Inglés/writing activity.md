I've had tons of problems with computers throughout my life, and most of the times the solution was to simply restart the device. The first step is to identify the problem, as always, and then look for a normal solution so it doesn't happen again. Restarting is the easiest way to solve a problem with computers, but this doesn't guarantee it won't happen again.
